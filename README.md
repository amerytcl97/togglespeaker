This App is developed with React Native. The app forces mobile to route all audio to built-in speaker.
The question is why? Because my current phone Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 have a hardware problem where the headphone jack malfunctioned and is forever stucked in headset mode.

Try the app if you want and if you want me to improve it further you can request through issues.
